## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm working on being a professional Data Scientist.
Recently I completed a Coding Bootcamp with a specialization in **Big Data**, and I am in love with coding. 
I graduated in Psychology and did a Master's in Neuropsychology, because I was fascinated by how the brain works, with its connections and way of learning, very similar to computers. Due to my passion for technology, I entered the sector as a Game Operator for Century Game and FunPlus in Beijing. Thanks to my hard work and motivation, in just one year I was promoted to **Community Manager**. Position in which I developed my analytic skills, by analyzing data and making big decisions based on it.
Related to this field, I currently finished the MBA program specializing in Digital Marketing at ThePower Business School. In addition, I have recently completed several courses, like a Tester Bootcamp, and a Google IT Support course on Coursera. 
I have skills in data analysis, programming languages such as SQL, R, and Python, KPI and Agile analysis (Scrum & Kanban), as well as personal skills such as creativity, responsibility, motivation, and problem solving skills.
